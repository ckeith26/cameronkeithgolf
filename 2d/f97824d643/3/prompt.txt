make the component darker, so no commits should be nothing (whatever the background color is)

I believe a previous fix used a hue over the image, but the github history still has white boxes

I still see the white boxes for no history. The white boxes should be black/dark

---

perfect, also instead of showing x active days in the last year. Show x contributions in the last year

---

yes, but the number of days is differen than the number of contributions from git

---

Now, I don't see  the number of contributions
