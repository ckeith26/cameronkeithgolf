Implement the following plan:

# Homepage Redesign: Flowing Section Experience

## Context

The current homepage has 4 disconnected sections (Hero, Terminal, Quick-links, Featured projects) that feel like stacked blocks with padding between them. Sub-pages (About, Work, Golf, Contact) hold great content that visitors never discover. The goal is to create a single flowing scroll experience where 7 sections blend into each other with subtle gradients and parallax — similar to top YC company landing pages — while keeping sub-pages as full detail pages.

## Sections (in order)

1. **Hero** — Full viewport height, name + tagline + scroll indicator
2. **Terminal** — AI chat (existing component, unchanged)
3. **Story Teaser** — 1-2 paragraphs from `aboutContent` + "Read full story" link
4. **Experience Highlights** — Top 3 current roles from `experiences` + "View full timeline" link
5. **Featured Projects** — 2 featured projects (existing) + "See all projects" link
6. **Golf Achievements** — Top 4-6 achievement stat cards + "Full golf career" link
7. **Contact CTA** — Email + social links + resume

## Architecture

### New Files to Create

**1. `src/components/interactive/ScrollSection.tsx`** (client component)
- Scroll-progress-aware section wrapper using Framer Motion `useScroll` + `useTransform`
- Props: `id`, `children`, `className`, `fullHeight?`, `parallax?`, `parallaxOffset?` (default 20px), `gradientTop?`, `gradientBottom?` (CSS gradient strings)
- Renders gradient overlay divs (h-32, absolute positioned, pointer-events-none) at top/bottom edges for color blending between sections
- Wraps children in `motion.div` with subtle vertical parallax when `parallax` is enabled
- Respects `useReducedMotion()` — falls back to plain `<section>` with no transforms
- Content area uses `max-w-[1200px] mx-auto px-6 md:px-8` (same as `SectionContainer`)

**2. `src/components/interactive/ScrollProgressBar.tsx`** (client component)
- 2px horizontal bar fixed at top of viewport, fills with emerald as page scrolls
- Uses `useScroll()` + `motion.div` with `scaleX: scrollYProgress`
- ~15 lines total

**3. `src/components/interactive/HomePageClient.tsx`** (client component)
- The main client-side homepage orchestrator with `"use client"`
- Composes all 7 `ScrollSection` sections with content
- Imports data from: `aboutContent`, `experiences`, `featuredProjects`, `golfData`, `socialLinks`
- Reuses existing components: `Terminal`, `TimelineEntry`, `ProjectCardFeatured`, `GolfStatCard`, `ScrollReveal`

### Files to Modify

**4. `src/app/page.tsx`**
- Stays as server component
- Replaces current content with `<PageLayout><HomePageClient /></PageLayout>`
- Clean and minimal — all logic lives in `HomePageClient`

**5. `src/styles/globals.css`**
- Add `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }` for hash-link navigation
- Add `.gradient-text-emerald` utility for accent-colored headings
- Add `@keyframes float-up` for scroll indicator animation

### Files Unchanged (reused as-is)
- `Terminal.tsx` — complex stateful component, no changes
- `BackgroundGrid.tsx` — fixed background layer, no changes
- `ProjectCardFeatured.tsx`, `GolfStatCard.tsx`, `TimelineEntry.tsx` — section components reused directly
- `ScrollReveal.tsx` — used for per-element entrance animations within sections
- `AsciiDivider.tsx` — not used on homepage (subtle gradients approach, not ASCII connectors)
- `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `PageLayout.tsx` — layout unchanged
- All sub-pages (`/about`, `/work`, `/golf`, `/contact`, `/projects`, `/blog`) — unchanged

## Section Details

### 1. Hero Section
- `min-h-screen flex items-center` — fills first viewport
- Name with staggered letter animation (Framer Motion `variants` + `staggerChildren: 0.03`)
- Tagline and bio paragraph fade in after
- Scroll-down indicator at bottom: "scroll" in mono font with gentle bounce animation (`animate={{ y: [0, 8, 0] }}`)
- Hero text gets parallax (drifts up slightly as you scroll past)
- **Gradient bottom**: `transparent → rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.02)` — faintest emerald warmth leading into terminal

### 2. Terminal Section
- Existing `<Terminal />` component, no wrapper `ScrollReveal` needed (terminal has its own boot sequence)
- Add subtle `box-shadow: 0 0 60px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.04)` to terminal container
- **Gradient bottom**: `rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.02) → transparent` — emerald fades out

### 3. Story Teaser Section
- h2: `aboutContent.headline` ("Builder. Competitor. Researcher.")
- Paragraph: `aboutContent.intro`
- Second paragraph: first 2 sentences of `aboutContent.sections[0].body`
- Link: "Read the full story →" to `/about`
- Parallax enabled (subtle float)
- **Gradient bottom**: `transparent → rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.015)`

### 4. Experience Highlights Section
- h2: "Experience"
- Filter `experiences` for `current: true`, take first 3
- Render with `TimelineEntry` in a `relative` container with the vertical timeline line (`absolute left-[7px] w-px bg-border`)
- Show role, org, dateRange, description, first bullet only
- Link: "View full timeline →" to `/work`
- `ScrollReveal` with staggered delays on each entry
- **Gradient bottom**: `rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.015) → transparent`

### 5. Featured Projects Section
- h2: "Featured Work"
- `featuredProjects.slice(0, 2)` rendered with `ProjectCardFeatured` in 2-column grid (same as current)
- Link: "See all projects →" to `/projects`
- `ScrollReveal` with staggered delays
- **Gradient bottom**: `transparent → rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.025)` — building toward golf

### 6. Golf Achievements Section
- h2: "Golf"
- Brief tagline: first sentence of `golfData.athleticBio`
- `golfData.achievements.slice(0, 4)` rendered with `GolfStatCard` in responsive grid (2-col mobile, 4-col desktop)
- Include Dartmouth logo on NCAA card (same logic as golf page)
- Link: "Full golf career →" to `/golf`
- `ScrollReveal` with staggered delays
- **Gradient bottom**: `rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.025) → rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.04)` — warm glow into CTA

### 7. Contact CTA Section
- h2: "Let's Connect"
- Email in `font-mono text-lg text-accent`
- Social links as icon row (reuse `socialLinks` data, render SVG icons inline with hover scale)
- Resume PDF button
- Centered layout, generous padding (`py-32`)
- Subtle radial gradient background: `radial-gradient(circle at 50% 50%, rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.05) 0%, transparent 60%)`

## Visual Flow Techniques

### Gradient Overlays
- Each `ScrollSection` can render 32px-tall gradient `<div>` overlays at its top/bottom edges
- These are `absolute`, `pointer-events-none`, `z-20`
- Creates subtle "temperature shifts" — the page isn't one flat color but has barely perceptible warmth changes
- All gradients use the emerald accent at very low opacity (0.015–0.04)

### Parallax
- Hero and Story sections get mild parallax (`useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [offset, -offset])`)
- Offset is 20px (barely noticeable but adds depth)
- Disabled on mobile (`md:` breakpoint check) and when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set

### Spacing Rhythm
- No hard borders or dividers between sections
- Consistent generous vertical padding: `py-24` for most sections, `py-32` for CTA
- Spacing alone, combined with gradients, creates the flowing feel

### Scroll Progress Bar
- Thin 2px emerald bar at very top of page
- Fills left-to-right as you scroll
- Ties the entire page together as one continuous experience

## Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full parallax, 2-col project grid, 4-col golf grid
- **Tablet (768-1023px)**: Parallax at half offset, 2-col grids
- **Mobile (<768px)**: No parallax, single column where needed, scroll progress bar stays
- Existing `clamp()` typography in `globals.css` handles font scaling

## Performance
- Single `useScroll()` at the `HomePageClient` level; derive per-section values with `useTransform`
- All transforms use `translateY` only (GPU-accelerated)
- Gradient overlays use `opacity` (cheap)
- `ScrollReveal` uses `viewport: { once: true }` — animates once, then stops
- `will-change: transform` only on elements that actually animate
- `BackgroundGrid` is unaffected (already uses direct DOM mutation)

## Implementation Order

1. Create `ScrollProgressBar.tsx` (~15 lines, simple)
2. Create `ScrollSection.tsx` (core new primitive)
3. Create `HomePageClient.tsx` (composes all 7 sections with data imports)
4. Update `page.tsx` (swap to render `HomePageClient`)
5. Add CSS utilities to `globals.css`
6. Test scroll performance and responsive behavior
7. Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks

## Verification

1. `npm run dev` — check homepage loads with all 7 sections
2. Scroll through entire page — sections should blend smoothly, no jarring breaks
3. Check each "View full..." link navigates to correct sub-page
4. Resize to mobile — verify responsive layout, no parallax jank
5. Enable `prefers-reduced-motion` in OS settings — verify clean fallback (no animations, all content visible)
6. Verify sub-pages (`/about`, `/work`, `/golf`, `/contact`) are unchanged
7. Test Terminal functionality — messages, commands, localStorage persistence still work
8. Check BackgroundGrid still renders behind all sections

these green accents are off. Let's also modify the terminal animation to start right away

Show a type writer effect also keep the first terminal style. We should render the claude code animation within that containter just like claude code does on my terminal.
