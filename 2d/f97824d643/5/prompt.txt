Implement the following plan:

# Fix Green Accents + Terminal Auto-Boot Redesign

## Context

After implementing the homepage redesign, two issues surfaced:
1. **Green gradient accents look off** — the emerald gradient overlays between sections are too visible / don't blend well with the dark background
2. **Terminal requires "Type cam to start"** — it should auto-boot the Claude Code animation immediately on scroll, inside the macOS terminal chrome (traffic lights), with typewriter effect

## Changes

### 1. Remove green gradient accents — `HomePageClient.tsx`

Remove all `gradientBottom` / `gradientTop` props from every `ScrollSection`. Also remove the radial gradient in the Contact CTA and the terminal shadow wrapper. The sections flow fine with just spacing — no artificial color shifts needed.

Sections affected:
- Hero: remove `gradientBottom`
- Terminal: remove `gradientBottom`, remove shadow wrapper div
- Story: remove `gradientBottom`
- Experience: remove `gradientBottom`
- Featured Projects: remove `gradientBottom`
- Golf: remove `gradientBottom`
- Contact CTA: remove the `radial-gradient` overlay div

### 2. Merge Terminal phases — `Terminal.tsx`

Currently there are two phases:
- **Phase 1** (lines 693-731): macOS chrome (traffic lights + "terminal") with `$ Type cam to start...` — shown before activation
- **Phase 2** (lines 734-830): Claude Code style with box-drawing chars (`╭───╮`), CK ASCII art, boot sequence, chat — shown after typing "cam"

**New behavior**: Single phase. macOS terminal chrome wraps the Claude Code content. Auto-boots on scroll into view.

#### Layout (top to bottom):
1. macOS title bar: traffic light dots + "terminal" label (same as current Phase 1)
2. CK ASCII art header + "Cam Code" / "cameronkeithgolf.com" labels
3. Horizontal divider (box-drawing `─` line)
4. Boot sequence output area (typewriter effect, auto-starts)
5. Input area with `❯` prompt (after boot completes)

#### Key changes:
- Remove `isActivated` state and `hasStarted` Phase 1 gate entirely
- Remove the Phase 1 render branch (the macOS-only simple terminal)
- Add macOS chrome (traffic lights + "terminal") as the outer wrapper for the existing Phase 2 layout
- Remove the box-drawing top/bottom edges (`╭╮` / `╰╯`) — the macOS `rounded-lg border` replaces them
- Keep `├───┤` divider between header and content area
- Auto-activate boot on IntersectionObserver trigger (when terminal scrolls into view at 30% threshold) — no user interaction needed
- Keep all existing functionality: typewriter boot, AI chat, slash commands, localStorage persistence, streaming responses

#### State simplification:
- Remove: `hasStarted`, `isActivated`, `hasRestoredSession` as separate gates
- The IntersectionObserver directly triggers `playBoot()` or session restore
- `bootComplete` remains to gate the input field

## Files to Modify

1. **`src/components/interactive/HomePageClient.tsx`** — Remove all gradient props and shadow wrapper
2. **`src/components/interactive/Terminal.tsx`** — Merge Phase 1 chrome with Phase 2 content, auto-boot

## Verification

1. `npm run build` — no type errors
2. `npm run dev` — homepage loads, no green tint between sections
3. Terminal auto-boots typewriter effect when scrolled into view (no "Type cam" needed)
4. After boot: CK ASCII art visible, chat input works, slash commands work
5. Existing localStorage session restore still works
6. Sub-pages unchanged

let's match this structure. 

the terminal should not have anything in it except my system typing cam in it. Then it should show the ck askii art under it and the two lines

how long should it take to set it up?

---

does it make sense for dns configuration to be stuck for an hour+? Should I delete the domain and try again?

how about now?

replace all references to cameronkeithgolf.com to         
  camkeith.me

---

if I press a link in the chat, it doesn't send me to the correct page (just home page)?
