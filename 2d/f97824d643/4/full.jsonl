The platform assembles a team of specialized buy-side AI agents (a Portfolio Manager, a Fundamentals Analyst, and a Risk Manager) that collaborate through a LangGraph orchestration layer to construct equity portfolios grounded in real data. Each agent retrieves live market data, SEC filings, and macroeconomic indicators via a RAG pipeline backed by MongoDB vector search, then reasons over the evidence before making allocation recommendations. The PM agent synthesizes competing views, enforces portfolio constraints, and outputs a final position set. The React front-end gives users a transparent window into every agent's reasoning chain, so they can audit decisions rather than blindly trust a black box. Deployed on AWS with CI/CD, Brama AI has processed thousands of research queries and demonstrated that multi-agent architectures can meaningfully augment, not replace, human investment judgment.\",\n    23→    techStack: [\"Python\", \"LangGraph\", \"RAG\", \"React\", \"MongoDB\", \"AWS\"],\n    24→    featured: true,\n    25→    links: { github: \"#\", live: \"#\" },\n    26→    date: \"November 2024 – Present\",\n    27→    category: \"ai-ml\",\n    28→  },\n    29→  {\n    30→    slug: \"guard-ai\",\n    31→    title: \"GUARD-AI\",\n    32→    description:\n    33→      \"A model-agnostic framework for protecting agentic AI systems from adversarial attacks, prompt injection, and unsafe tool use.\",\n    34→    longDescription:\n    35→      \"As agentic systems gain real-world autonomy (browsing the web, executing code, managing files), the attack surface expands dramatically.

The architecture introduces three checkpoints: an input sentinel that detects prompt-injection and jailbreak attempts using lightweight classifier heads, a tool-call auditor that validates every proposed action against a configurable policy before execution, and an output verifier that scans responses for data leakage and harmful content. Each layer is model-agnostic, meaning it can protect GPT, Claude, or open-source agents equally. The framework was evaluated against a custom red-team benchmark of over 500 adversarial prompts spanning direct injection, indirect injection via retrieved documents, and multi-turn social engineering. GUARD-AI reduced successful attacks by over 90 percent while adding less than 200 ms of latency per turn.

A matching algorithm scores potential pairings on multiple dimensions and surfaces the highest-quality connections each week.

Built with React on the front-end and a Node.js API layer, the application is deployed on AWS with auto-scaling groups behind an ALB.

The transcript feeds into a sentiment extraction module built on a fine-tuned FinBERT variant that scores utterances on bullish-to-bearish scales while tagging named entities (companies, metrics, forward guidance). A downstream trading module maps sentiment deltas to position-sizing logic and can route orders via a brokerage API. The system was backtested on two quarters of S&P 500 earnings calls, and the sentiment signal showed statistically significant predictive power for the 30-minute post-call price move.

The authentication layer supports multiple roles (admin, moderator, and member), each with granular permissions enforced server-side. Admins can manage channels and revoke access; moderators can pin messages and mute users; members can read and write within their assigned channels. The React front-end provides a real-time chat experience powered by WebSockets, while the Node.js backend persists encrypted blobs to a database that is useless without the corresponding private keys.

     \"AI-powered investment tools that democratize financial research through a team of autonomous buy-side agents.\",\n    longDescription:\n      \"Brama AI was born from a simple question: why should sophisticated investment research be locked behind six-figure Bloomberg terminals and hedge-fund paywalls? The platform assembles a team of specialized buy-side AI agents (a Portfolio Manager, a Fundamentals Analyst, and a Risk Manager) that collaborate through a LangGraph orchestration layer to construct equity portfolios grounded in real data. Each agent retrieves live market data, SEC filings, and macroeconomic indicators via a RAG pipeline backed by MongoDB vector search, then reasons over the evidence before making allocation recommendations. The PM agent synthesizes competing views, enforces portfolio constraints, and outputs a final position set. The React front-end gives users a transparent window into every agent's reasoning chain, so they can audit decisions rather than blindly trust a black box. Deployed on AWS with CI/CD, Brama AI has processed thousands of research queries and demonstrated that multi-agent architectures can meaningfully augment, not replace, human investment judgment.\",\n    techStack: [\"Python\", \"LangGraph\", \"RAG\", \"React\", \"MongoDB\", \"AWS\"],\n    featured: true,\n    links: { github: \"#\", live: \"#\" },\n    date: \"November 2024 – Present\",\n    category: \"ai-ml\",\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"guard-ai\",\n    title: \"GUARD-AI\",\n    description:\n      \"A model-agnostic framework for protecting agentic AI systems from adversarial attacks, prompt injection, and unsafe tool use.\",\n    longDescription:\n      \"As agentic systems gain real-world autonomy (browsing the web, executing code, managing files), the attack surface expands dramatically. GUARD-AI addresses this with a layered defense framework that wraps any LLM-powered agent in a safety envelope without modifying the underlying model. The architecture introduces three checkpoints: an input sentinel that detects prompt-injection and jailbreak attempts using lightweight classifier heads, a tool-call auditor that validates every proposed action against a configurable policy before execution, and an output verifier that scans responses for data leakage and harmful content. Each layer is model-agnostic, meaning it can protect GPT, Claude, or open-source agents equally. The framework was evaluated against a custom red-team benchmark of over 500 adversarial prompts spanning direct injection, indirect injection via retrieved documents, and multi-turn social engineering. GUARD-AI reduced successful attacks by over 90 percent while adding less than 200 ms of latency per turn. Written up as a technical paper, the work demonstrates that safety and capability are not a zero-sum trade-off.\",\n    techStack: [\"Python\", \"LLM/VLMs\", \"Security\", \"PyTorch\"],\n    featured: true,\n    links: { paper: \"#\" },\n    date: \"2025\",\n    category: \"research\",\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"coffee-chats\",\n    title: \"Coffee Chats\",\n    description:\n      \"AI-powered networking platform that intelligently matches college students with alumni for mentorship conversations.\",\n    longDescription:\n      \"Networking in college often feels random: a cold LinkedIn message here, an awkward career fair handshake there. Coffee Chats replaces that friction with an intelligent matching engine that pairs students with alumni based on shared interests, career goals, and conversational compatibility. Users create profiles enriched with embeddings generated from their bios, interests, and professional experience. A matching algorithm scores potential pairings on multiple dimensions and surfaces the highest-quality connections each week. The platform handles the entire lifecycle: profile creation, match notifications, calendar scheduling, and post-chat feedback that refines future matches. Built with React on the front-end and a Node.js API layer, the application is deployed on AWS with auto-scaling groups behind an ALB. The feedback loop proved critical: after the first round of chats, match acceptance rates climbed as the system learned which factors actually predicted a good conversation versus which looked good on paper.\",\n    techStack: [\"React\", \"Node.js\", \"AWS\", \"Full Stack\"],\n    featured: true,\n    links: { github: \"#\", live: \"#\" },\n    date: \"2024\",\n    category: \"full-stack\",\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"realtime-earnings-pipeline\",\n    title: \"Real-time Earnings Calls Pipeline\",\n    description:\n      \"End-to-end system that transcribes live earnings calls, extracts sentiment, and executes trades in real time.\",\n    longDescription:\n      \"Earnings calls move markets, but by the time a human analyst finishes listening, the alpha is gone. This pipeline closes that gap by processing audio streams in near real-time. A fine-tuned Whisper ASR model, trained on over 5,000 hours of financial audio to handle jargon like 'EBITDA,' 'guidance,' and ticker symbols, transcribes speech with sub-second latency. The transcript feeds into a sentiment extraction module built on a fine-tuned FinBERT variant that scores utterances on bullish-to-bearish scales while tagging named entities (companies, metrics, forward guidance). A downstream trading module maps sentiment deltas to position-sizing logic and can route orders via a brokerage API. The system was backtested on two quarters of S&P 500 earnings calls, and the sentiment signal showed statistically significant predictive power for the 30-minute post-call price move.

I used Autodesk Fusion 360 to design every component and integrate electronics into the design. I 3D printed all of the parts except for the electronics and the laser-cut acrylic backplate for the controller. I implemented a direct rear wheel drive with two 12v motors, and designed a mounting system to house them securely. For steering, I developed a linear actuator to drive responsive steering with a servo. The wheels were a two piece design. I printed the rim out of rigid PLA filament and the tires out of TPU 95A rubber filament. This allowed the car to drive on slick surfaces and accelerate quicker. To control the car, I programmed a pair of Arduino Pro Minis with 1000m NRF24 transceivers. A 12v battery supplied power to the car, and I used a step down controller to decrease the voltage to 5v for the Arduino, servo, and speed controller. I had a great experience building a RC Car from scratch, and I was glad to step outside my comfort zone of developing software and hone my hardware engineering skills as well. Final PresentationPerfect Strike RenderPerfect Strike Render1/1Perfect Strike - Hit tour level golf shotsI designed, 3D printed, and tested a custom golf training aid to help improve putting. The putting clip works for all putters, and helps golfers at all levels to putt better.top_5_resultstop_5_results1/1Do Outliers Matter?Training sample quality impacts on deep learning model performances. While studies in the literature explored the association of outlier samples to model performance in modalities like text or images in the NLP and computer vision domains, it is relatively underexplored in the domain of video classifications. Researchers focused on anomaly detection or theoretical bounding of outliers towards video classifications. However, explicit, systematic empirical studies of the impacts of these outliers on video classification modeling are still yet to be explored. Therefore, to bridge this gap, in this work, we systematically analyze the impacts of outliers, specifically in-distribution outliers, on video classification performances and show that reducing the outliers from training can improve video classification performances. Websitekeras_video_classification_sports_dataset92.5keras_video_classification_sports_dataset1/2Video Action Classifier I built Binary and Multi Class models to classify video actions in my CS 74 class, Machine Learning. First, I leveraged the precomputed features for the project to run a time series and SVM model over 20 frames for each video and train the classifiers. Then, I designed a bayesian hyper-parameter optimizer to tune the model. I achieved the highest test accuracy, 100% and 96.6% in my class, and outperformed 200 CS students in both competitions. I also beat the next best scores in each competition by 10%. Binary Competition Multi-Class Competition Link92.592.51/1Neural Network Digit Classifier I built a neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits in my CS 70 class, Foundations of Applied Computer Science and Machine Learning. First, I implemented forward computation and backward propagation for linear and non-linear ReLU layers as well as dropout. I also used gradient descent with Least squares to train the model. Finally, I designed a bayesian hyper-parameter optimizer to tune the model. I also achieved the highest accuracy, 92.5% in my class and won a citation among 150 CS majors at Dartmouth.Poison BlendingPoison Blending1/1Poisson Image Blending I implemented Poisson Image Blending in my CS 70 class, Foundations of Applied Computer Science and Machine Learning. This assignment explores gradient-domain image processing, a simple technique with a broad set of applications including blending, tone-mapping, and non-photorealistic rendering. The primary goal of this assignment is to seamlessly blend an object or texture from a source image into a target image. The simplest method would be to just copy and paste the pixel values from one image directly into the other. Unfortunately, this will create very noticeable seams, even if the backgrounds are well-matched. The insight is that our visual system is often more sensitive to the gradient of an image (how quickly the pixel values change left-right and up-down) than the overall intensity. We will therefore set up the problem as finding values for the pasted target pixels that maximally preserve the gradient of the source region without changing any of the background pixels. Note that we are making a deliberate decision here to ignore the overall intensity! So a green hat could turn red, but it will still look like a hat. As you can see, my Poisson implementation works well. Forensic License PlateForensic License Plate1/1Forensic License Plate Recognition I implemented a license plate forensic algorithm in my CS 70 class, Foundations of Applied Computer Science and Machine Learning. I removed the distortion in an image of a planar surface, and move one's perspective so the license plate appears face on. We want to deduce the entries of the homography that maps the four corners we clicked above to the four corners of an undistorted rectangular license plate. Our unknowns are the elements of the homography matrix: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, while, for a given pair of corresponding points, x, y and x', y' are known. w' is not known per say but can be deduced easily from other unknowns and known quantities. Each pair of points gives you two constraints, and you have four such pairs, giving you 8 constraints on 8 unknowns. After mapping the points from the original image to the new image, we can now read the license plate: 153 7Z03.

We achieved superior risk-adjusted returns, and I am currently in the process of testing the strategy with realtime data. Tiny Search Engine data structureTiny Search Engine data structure1/1Tiny Search Engine I created a Tiny Search Engine in my CS 50 class at Dartmouth (Software Design and Implementation). I composed the project into three parts: crawler, indexer, and querier. First, I designed the crawler module to crawl the web and retrieve webpages starting from a \"seed\" URL. It parses the seed webpage, extracts any embedded URLs, then retrieves each of those pages, recursively, but limiting its exploration to a given \"depth.\" Furthermore, the crawler will only crawl pages under the seed domain. Next, indexer reads the document files produced by the crawler, builds an index, and writes that index to a file. Its companion, the index tester, loads an index file produced by the indexer and saves it to another file. Finally, querier reads the index file produced by the indexer, and page files produced by the Querier, and answers search queries submitted via stdin.HMMHMM1/1Parts of Speech Predictor I developed a Parts of Speech Model in my CS 10 class at Dartmouth (Object Oriented Programming). I created a Hidden Markov Model from training data files with sentences and tagged sentences. I used two hash maps, observations and transitions to train the data both of type HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Double>>. Observations keeps track of the number of times a String is a certain part of speech. Transitions hold the number of times a part of speech transitioned to another. Then, I converted those occurrences to probabilities. The model calculates the most probable next part of speech and outputs them in a new \"tagged\" file. (It uses those log probabilities to backtrace from the state with the best score for the last observation and works back to the start state). Ultimately, I achieved over 90% accuracy with my program.

Let me compare what's on the Wix site with what's in the current projects.ts file and update the descriptions accordingly.\n\nLet me map the Wix site projects to the current projects:\n\n1. **Coffee Chats** - Wix: \"Coffee Chats is a networking app that helps students and early-career professionals connect with the right alumni and mentors. It matches you to relevant people and streamlines outreach and scheduling so conversations get booked without back-and-forth. The result is more high-quality coffee chats and faster career learning and opportunities.\"\n\n2. **Brama AI** - Wix: \"Brama AI redefines how individuals invest. \nWe leverage cutting-edge AI to deliver institutional-grade financial insights, empowering everyone—from newcomers to seasoned investors—to make smarter, data-driven decisions.\"\n\n3. **WhisperChain+** - Wix: \"WhisperChain+ is a secure, anonymous messaging platform designed for learning communities where users can send encrypted compliments and encouragement while maintaining strict privacy and accountability standards. The system implements role-based access control (RBAC), comprehensive audit logging, and advanced cryptographic security measures.\"\n\n4. **Moves AI App** - Wix: \"Moves AI helps friends plan their perfect night out. We built this app for the final project of our full stack development class.\"\n\n5. **1/16 GT2RS RC Car** - This is a NEW project not in the current projects.ts! It's from the Digital Fabrication class (COSC 29.05).\n\n6. **Perfect Strike** - Wix: \"I designed, 3D printed, and tested a custom golf training aid to help improve putting. The putting clip works for all putters, and helps golfers at all levels to putt better.\"\n\n7. **Do Outliers Matter?** - This is a NEW project! Research on training sample quality impacts on deep learning model performances in video classification\n\nFor Moves AI, groups create events and invite friends to swipe through yes/no preference questions, then I use Llama 3 on the backend to generate personalized itineraries that match everyone's location and activity preferences for the night.\n\n8. **Video Action Classifier** - I built binary and multi-class models for video action classification, using precomputed features with time series and SVM models across 20-frame sequences, then optimized hyperparameters with a Bayesian approach. I achieved 100% and 96.6% test accuracy, outperforming 200 classmates and beating the next best scores by 10%.\n\n9. **Neural Network Digit Classifier** - I implemented a neural network from scratch for handwritten digit classification, building out forward computation and backpropagation for linear and non-linear layers.\n\nFinishing the digit classifier work with dropout regularization and gradient descent optimization, then tuning hyperparameters to reach 92.5% accuracy and win a citation among 150 CS majors.\n\n10. **Poisson Image Blending** - Worked on gradient-domain image processing techniques.\n\n11. **Forensic License Plate Recognition** - Applied distortion removal and homography transformations.\n\n12. **AI and ML (UChicago)** - Completed coursework and developed a final project around REIT trading strategy.\n\n13. **Tiny Search Engine** - Built a search engine with crawler, indexer, and querier components.\n\n14. **Parts of Speech Predictor** - Implemented an HMM model for predicting parts of speech.\n\nNow I'm looking at the remaining projects that need descriptions filled in. I see there are several projects without long descriptions yet—Moves AI App, Video Action ML Competition, Perfect Strike, and a few collaborative note apps. I also notice there's a new Texas Hold-Em App project that isn't in the current projects list, and the CO2 Race Car project needs its description added as well. Gradient Descent Regression (not on Wix, keep from resume)\n- Neural Network Digit Classifier\n- Poisson Image Blending\n- Forensic License Plate Recognition\n- Tiny Search Engine\n- Parts of Speech Predictor\n- CO2 Race Car\n\n**Projects that need description/longDescription corrections (currently have content):**\n- Coffee Chats - update descriptions from Wix\n- Brama AI - descriptions seem OK already, but let me check\n- WhisperChain+ - update from Wix\n- Real-time Earnings Pipeline - not on Wix as a separate project, but on resume\n\n**New projects to ADD:**\n- 1/16 GT2RS RC Car (from Digital Fabrication class)\n- Do Outliers Matter? (video research)\n- Texas Hold-Em App (high school project)\n- AI and ML at UChicago (summer course)\n\nI need to update existing project descriptions using the Wix content, add the missing projects from Wix, and make sure everything aligns with what's on the resume. Looking back at the resume, I see GUARD-AI and Real-time Earnings Calls Pipeline are already on the site but not on Wix, while Keyfactor, Trivariate Research, and SEE Lab are work experience rather than projects, so those shouldn't be included here. .ts. I need to be careful and thorough.\n\nFor existing projects with longDescriptions already written (Brama AI, GUARD-AI, Coffee Chats, Real-time Earnings Pipeline, WhisperChain+), I should update them to better match the Wix site content while keeping the good detail we already have.\n\nActually, let me re-read the user's request: \"look at my resume and update the projects so that they reflect what I did. Go through each project on my wix site and transfer that information to my projects page\"\n\nSo the key task is:\n1. Make project descriptions accurate to what he actually did (from resume + Wix)\n2. Transfer Wix project info to the portfolio site\n3. Add any missing projects from Wix\n\nLet me plan the changes:\n\n**Updates to existing projects:**\n\n1. **Brama AI** - I need to ground this in what's actually documented. The Wix describes it as using cutting-edge AI to deliver institutional-grade financial insights and democratize investment research. The resume adds that I built a team of buy-side AI agents handling different roles to construct portfolios based on user preferences and risk profiles. I'll combine these to be accurate without embellishment.\n\n2. **GUARD-AI** - This one isn't on Wix, so I should stick to what the resume says: a model-agnostic framework to protect agentic systems, with a technical paper. The current description oversells it, so I'll dial it back to match the actual scope.\n\n3. **Coffee Chats** - The Wix describes it as an AI networking platform matching students with alumni for coffee chats, with streamlined scheduling. The resume adds that I deployed it on AWS. The current description is too flowery, so I'll use the Wix language which is more grounded.\n\n4. **Real-time Earnings Pipeline** - This is mentioned in the intro but not as a standalone project on Wix. The resume describes transcribing earnings calls, fine-tuning an ASR model on 5000 hours of data, and training a custom sentiment LLM. The description cuts off mid-sentence, so I need to infer the rest was about extracting drivers for trading decisions.\n\n5. **WhisperChain+** - The Wix version oversells the security features. The resume is more concrete: it's a React app with user, moderator, and admin roles, email verification with one-time codes, and RSA-OAEP encryption with SHA-256 hashing. I should use the resume details instead.\n\n6. **Moves AI App** - This was a full stack class project where groups create \"moves\" and invite friends to swipe on activities for planning nights out. The description is cut off but that's the core concept.\n\n7. **Video Action ML Competition** - Need to pull the full description from Wix and update the description, longDescription, techStack, and date fields.\n\n8. **Perfect Strike** - A custom 3D-printed golf training aid for putting that works with any putter. The description is straightforward but I should check if there's more detail needed.\n\nNow looking at the projects that are only on the resume and need to be added or updated: there's a golf-focused social media app with MongoDB that includes custom authentication and CRUD operations, a Firebase notes app with real-time syncing built in React, a YouTube clone leveraging the Google API, and then some machine learning classifier projects including k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, logistic regression, and perceptron models that need their longDescriptions pulled from the resume.\n\nFor the remaining projects already on Wix—gradient descent regression, neural network digit classifier, Poisson image blending, forensic license plate recognition, tiny search engine, parts of speech predictor, and CO2 race car—I need to update their descriptions. I should also add four new projects: an RC car build, a research paper on outliers, a Texas Hold-Em poker app, and something on AI and ML at UChic.\n\nI'm reconsidering the JP Morgan virtual experience—it's more of a certification than a standalone project, so I'll leave it off the projects page and focus on actual projects I've built. The main goal is to pull descriptions from the Wix site first, then supplement with resume details where needed.\n\nThe current project descriptions are too polished and may contain inaccurate details, so I should ground everything in what's actually on the Wix site and resume. I'll use those as the foundation and only add context where it genuinely helps explain the work. Now I'm going to write out the full updated projects file, starting with the featured ones and then moving through the new additions like the GT2RS RC car.\n\nFor the remaining projects, I'm looking at the digital fabrication course work from summer 2024 with Arduino and 3D printing, the outliers research project that ties into computer vision work, and the Texas Hold-Em poker app from high school. I'll organize these with accurate dates, categories, and tech stacks pulled directly from the source materials.\n\nNow I'm reviewing which projects deserve the featured treatment. The current set—Brama AI, GUARD-AI, Coffee Chats, Real-time Earnings Pipeline, and WhisperChain+—feels solid, so I'll leave those as is. The RC car project has great documentation and visuals but wasn't explicitly highlighted, so I'll keep it unstarred for now.\n\nBefore I write everything out, I need to be careful about accuracy—sticking to what's actually on the Wix site and resume without adding my own spin. For projects already on Wix, I'll pull directly from the user's own descriptions. For resume-only projects, I'll synthesize the bullet points into something concise.\n\nI'm noticing the Wix descriptions use first-person voice while the current portfolio site leans toward third-person or passive construction. I should convert those to match the portfolio's existing tone—keeping all the substance but making it feel more polished and consistent with the site's style.\n\nNow I'm cross-referencing the dates from the resume to make sure everything lines up correctly. Looking at the discrepancies between what's listed and what should be there, I need to update several project dates. Most of these are off by a year or need more specific month ranges—like GUARD-AI and Coffee Chats both shifting to October-November 2025, Real-time Earnings moving to March-June 2025, and a few others needing adjustments back to 2024 or earlier months in 2025. I'm seeing there are quite a few date corrections needed across the projects. Let me systematically go through and update all of them to match the actual timelines. For the project descriptions, I should lean on the Wix content since that's what was explicitly requested, but I'll need to flesh out the shorter ones with details from the resume to make sure the portfolio pages have enough substance. For projects that don't currently have long descriptions, I'll need to decide whether to add them or leave them minimal depending on whether they're featured.\n\nI should also track down the correct external links—some projects have live sites like coffeechats.org and bramaai.com, while others have deployed versions or competition links, though I'm aware some of these might not be permanent. to the SEE Lab research on video classification and outlier detection, which aligns with the NeurIPS paper work. I'll mark it as 2025 research since that's when the AI Researcher role began. For the GT2RS RC Car project, I need to pull the full description from the Wix site to capture the design and build details accurately.\n\nProgramming the Arduino controllers... I'm deciding on the right tone for the portfolio descriptions. The current featured projects use third-person narrative, while the Wix content is in first-person. For consistency across a personal portfolio site, I should convert everything to third-person to match the existing style. Now I'll structure the projects file with concise one-sentence descriptions for the cards and longer third-person narratives pulled from the Wix content and resume details.\n\nDefining the project interface... Defining the project schema... Continuing with the framework's layered defense approach — input validation catches prompt injections, a tool auditor enforces policies before execution, and output verification prevents data leakage. I wrote a technical paper documenting the implementation and showing that safety doesn't compromise capability. Now moving into the Coffee Chats project, which is a networking platform connecting students and professionals with mentors and alumni. connect with the right alumni and mentors. It matches users to relevant people and streamlines outreach and scheduling so conversations get booked without back-and-forth. The result is more high-quality coffee chats and faster career learning and opportunities.\n\nThe platform handles the entire lifecycle: profile creation, intelligent matching, calendar scheduling, and post-chat feedback that refines future matches. Deployed on scalable AWS infrastructure with auto-scaling behind a load balancer.\n\nFor the earnings calls project, I built an end-to-end pipeline that transcribes earnings calls in real-time and executes trades based on extracted market signals. The system fine-tuned an ASR model on thousands of hours of earnings call audio to accurately handle financial terminology, then feeds transcripts into a custom sentiment model that identifies both hard drivers like revenue figures and soft drivers like management tone, which ultimately route to position-sizing logic and brokerage APIs. Defining the project structure... I'm seeing that the research work demonstrates how filtering out in-distribution outliers during training can boost video classification performance, using Python and PyTorch for the implementation. Then there's a separate project about a custom-built 1/16 scale RC car with 3D-printed components and Arduino controls that was completed for a digital fabrication class.\n\nFor the RC car specifically, I designed every part in Fusion 360 with integrated electronics, 3D-printed most components except for the electronics and a laser-cut acrylic controller backplate. The car runs on dual 12V motors for rear-wheel drive with a servo-controlled linear actuator for steering, and the wheels use a hybrid approach with rigid PLA rims and flexible TPU rubber tires for better grip. Communication between the car and controller happens through Arduino Pro Minis paired with NRF24 transceivers at 1000m range, powered by a 12V battery with a step-down converter supplying 5V to the Arduino and control systems.\n\nNow I'm looking at the next project, which is a social app called Moves AI that helps friend groups coordinate their nights out using AI recommendations.\n\nContinuing with the project portfolio data... I'm looking at project data for a golf training aid and a collaborative notes app, organizing the metadata and descriptions for each one. Continuing with the project data structure... Now I'm moving through the project portfolio, documenting a logistic regression and perceptron implementation built entirely from scratch using cross-entropy loss and smooth ReLU activation, followed by a gradient descent regression project.\n\nContinuing with the portfolio entries... I implemented Poisson Image Blending for the same course, which uses gradient-domain processing to seamlessly composite images by preserving source gradients rather than pixel values directly. The key insight is that human vision is more sensitive to gradients than absolute intensity, so the algorithm solves for target pixel values that maintain the source region's gradient structure while keeping background pixels unchanged — allowing objects to shift in color but retain their visual identity.\n\nNow I'm moving on to another project on forensic license plate recognition, which uses homography transformations to correct perspective distortion in surveillance footage. The algorithm computes a homography matrix that maps four corner points from the distorted plate view to the corners of a properly aligned rectangle, effectively removing the viewing angle to make the plate readable.\n\nI'm also including a course project from UChicago on AI and Machine Learning where I developed a quantitative trading strategy for REITs using machine learning combined with sentiment analysis and time series forecasting. from data investigation and exploration to supervised and unsupervised learning.\n\nThe final project developed a quantitative trading strategy for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) that leverages machine learning, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis to identify undervalued REITs within specific sectors and sub-sectors. The strategy uses market data from FactSet, sentiment analysis on REITs, and historical price data to make informed investment decisions, achieving superior risk-adjusted returns.\n\nNow looking at the Tiny Search Engine project—a complete search engine built in C with three core modules. The crawler starts from a seed URL, extracts and recursively retrieves linked pages up to a specified depth while staying within the seed domain. The indexer then processes those documents to build an inverted index, and the querier uses that index to answer search queries, with efficiency optimized through a hashtable-to-counter data structure.\n\nMoving on to the Parts of Speech Predictor, which uses a Hidden Markov Model trained on tagged sentences to classify words with over 93% accuracy. The model maintains two hash maps—one tracking how often words appear as specific parts of speech, and another recording transitions between consecutive parts of speech.\n\nContinuing with the CO2 Race Car Project... Defining project data structure...\n\nI need to update both the short and long descriptions to match what the user actually did. For the Parts of Speech Predictor project, I'm noticing a discrepancy—the resume mentions it's from CS 10 at Dartmouth, which uses Java, but the current tech stack lists Python and NLP tools. I should verify the actual language used and correct the tech stack accordingly, since the code references suggest Java was involved.\n\nI'm also reviewing what projects exist on the resume versus what's currently on the Wix site and in the projects file. There are several projects listed on the resume that aren't showing up in the portfolio yet—like the Real-time Earnings Calls Pipeline, GUARD-AI, and various machine learning classifier projects. I should decide whether these should be added to the portfolio or if they're intentionally excluded.\n\nI'm also noticing the \"Do Outliers Matter?\" project needs some clarification since it appears to be research work from the SEE Lab, and given the recent AI Researcher role starting in January 2025, the date should probably reflect that it's a current or very recent project, possibly the NeurIPS paper being worked on.\n\nFor Moves AI specifically, the description is completely off—it should be a social app for planning nights out, not an AI movement analysis tool. And the tech stack needs updating too since it's a web-based full-stack project from COSC 52 using Llama 3 on the backend, not a React Native mobile app.\n\nI'll keep the existing image references since I don't have access to the Wix image files, then finalize the projects file with these corrections.\n\nI'm also reconsidering the order of the non-featured projects—chronological order from most recent makes more sense, so I'll arrange them by date starting with the 2025 project down through the summer 2024 ones. I'll organize these projects in reverse chronological order for the non-featured items and start writing the file

Each layer is model-agnostic, meaning it can protect GPT, Claude, or open-source agents equally. The framework was evaluated against a custom red-team benchmark of over 500 adversarial prompts spanning direct injection, indirect injection via retrieved documents, and multi-turn social engineering.
