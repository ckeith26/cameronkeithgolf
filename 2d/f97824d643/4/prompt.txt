Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Course Detail Pages & Enhanced Coursework Cards

## Context

The about page currently displays courses as simple cards showing only code, title, and term. The user wants to:
1. Add publicly available course descriptions from the Dartmouth ORC catalog to each course
2. Add hover effects to course cards (matching the existing project card pattern)
3. Create individual course detail pages that follow the same pattern as project detail pages (`/projects/[slug]`)

## Files to Modify

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/data/coursework.ts` | Add `slug`, `description`, `category`, and `distributive` fields to `Course` interface; populate all 32 courses with ORC descriptions |
| `src/app/about/page.tsx` | Wrap course cards in `<Link>` tags with hover effects matching `ProjectCardCompact` |
| `src/app/courses/[slug]/page.tsx` | **New** — Course detail page following `projects/[slug]/page.tsx` pattern |

## Step 1: Expand the `Course` interface and data (`src/data/coursework.ts`)

Update the `Course` interface:
```ts
export interface Course {
  code: string;
  title: string;
  term: string;
  slug: string;           // URL-safe identifier (e.g., "cosc-74")
  description: string;    // ORC catalog description
  category: string;       // Parent category label for the detail page badge
  distributive?: string;  // e.g., "QDS", "SOC", "TLA", "SCI"
}
```

Add descriptions sourced from the Dartmouth ORC catalog (`dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com`). For topics courses without specific ORC descriptions (COSC 29.05, COSC 89.30, COSC 99.01, HIST 94.06, ASCL 62.03, COLT 57.02, CHEM 7.05, PHIL 1.09), use brief accurate summaries based on the umbrella course description and publicly known context.

Each course gets a `slug` derived from its code (e.g., `"COSC 74"` → `"cosc-74"`, `"ECON 1"` → `"econ-1"`).

The `category` field will be set from the parent `CourseCategory.label` during data population, so each course knows its own category for the detail page.

## Step 2: Add hover effects and links to course cards (`src/app/about/page.tsx`)

Transform the static `<div>` cards into `<Link>` elements with the same hover pattern used by `ProjectCardCompact`:
- `hover:scale-[1.02] hover:border-accent/40 transition-all duration-200`
- Link to `/courses/${course.slug}`

Reuse: Pattern from `src/components/sections/ProjectCardCompact.tsx` (line 22):
```
className="... transition-all duration-200 hover:scale-[1.02] hover:border-accent/40"
```

The about page will need `"use client"` **only if** interactive elements are added. Since `<Link>` is a server component, no client conversion is needed — the current server component pattern stays intact.

## Step 3: Create course detail page (`src/app/courses/[slug]/page.tsx`)

Mirror the structure of `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`:
- `generateStaticParams()` — iterate all courses from all categories
- `generateMetadata()` — dynamic title/description from course data
- Layout: back link → title → code + term + category badge + distributive badge → description paragraphs
- Reuse existing components: `PageLayout`, `SectionContainer`, `Badge`, `ScrollReveal`

Key differences from project detail page:
- No tech stack / links section (courses don't have GitHub/live links)
- Show course code prominently with `font-mono text-accent`
- Show term formatted nicely (e.g., "24S" → "Spring 2024")
- Show distributive requirement as a badge if present

### Term formatting helper
Add a small utility to format term codes:
- `"24S"` → `"Spring 2024"`, `"24W"` → `"Winter 2024"`, `"24F"` → `"Fall 2024"`, `"24X"` → `"Summer 2024"`
- `"26W"` → `"Winter 2026"`, etc.

This can live in the detail page file or in `coursework.ts`.

## Verification

1. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `/about` — confirm course cards have hover effects and link to `/courses/[slug]`
2. Click a course card → verify the detail page renders with back link, title, code, term, category badge, distributive badge, and description
3. Navigate directly to `/courses/cosc-74` (or any slug) — verify it renders correctly
4. Navigate to a non-existent slug like `/courses/fake` — verify 404 behavior
5. Check that `npm run build` succeeds (static params generated for all courses)
