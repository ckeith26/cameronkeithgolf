# Why Build a Personal Site From Scratch?

There are plenty of portfolio templates out there. Drag-and-drop builders, Notion pages exported as websites, single-page resumes hosted on GitHub Pages. They work fine, but they all feel the same.

I wanted something that reflected how I actually think about building software: typed data layers, component-driven architecture, and content I can version-control alongside code. So I built this site with **Next.js 16**, **TypeScript**, and **MDX**.

## The Stack

Here is a quick look at what powers this site:

- **Next.js 16 App Router** for file-based routing and React Server Components
- **MDX** via `next-mdx-remote` for blog posts that mix Markdown with React
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling without leaving the markup
- **Framer Motion** for scroll-triggered animations
- **Shiki** via `rehype-pretty-code` for syntax highlighting

## A Sample: Data-Driven Projects

Every project on this site is defined in a single TypeScript file. Here is what one entry looks like:

```python
# Not the actual site code, but here's a quick Python example
# to show off syntax highlighting in this blog.

def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Generate the first n Fibonacci numbers."""
    sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return sequence

print(fibonacci(10))
# [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## What Is Next

This blog will be a place for me to write about:

- AI/ML research and side projects
- Lessons from competing in D1 golf and building startups simultaneously
- Technical deep-dives into tools and frameworks I use
- Reflections on the intersection of finance, technology, and competition

If you have made it this far, thanks for reading. More posts coming soon.
